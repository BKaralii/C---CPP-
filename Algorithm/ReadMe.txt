## The Task :bangbang:	
	
Task is to write a C code that will compute a special quantity. The rightmost digit d1 in the 10-digit code  d10d9d8 ... d1 is uniquely determined from the other 9 digits such that d1+ 2d2 + 3d3 + ... + 10d10 is a multiple of 11. d1 can be any value from 0 to 10. Example: d1 corresponding to 020131452 is 5 since 5 is the only value of d1 between 0 and 10 for which d1 + 2*2 + 3*5 + 4*4 + 5*1 + 6*3 + 7*1 + 8*0 + 9*2 + 10*0 is a multiple of 11. Write a program that takes a 9-digit integer as a command-line argument, computes d1, and prints the resulting 10-digit number. It's ok if you don't print any leading 0s.
